- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Ishrat <3 your local klutz and a third year comp sci student
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in web dev, networks, and art 
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how iptables work...
- ğŸ“« reach me via email: ishratnaba2002@gmail.com

When I'm not programming or reading, I like to do art, sing, peruse underground markets, practice my spanish,
do deep dive analysis on bad netflix shows and read about random space facts ğŸŒŒ 

(did you know that just spending one year in the gravitational pull of a black hole is equivalent to about 80 earth years?)

I love to fiddle around and learn new things, so I'll update that here as I go along~
